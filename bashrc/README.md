# BASHRC
This is my personal `.bashrc` file. 
Note that this is only additions to add to the top of your already existing `.bashrc`
Note that some of the aliases are to directories containing custom build packages that are also included in this repository at https://github.com/HeinrichWizardKreuser/Wizard-s-Ubuntu-Pop-_OS-setup/tree/main/sandbox/packages
