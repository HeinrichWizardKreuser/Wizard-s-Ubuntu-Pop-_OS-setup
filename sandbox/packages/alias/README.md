# Alias scripts

These are scripts that need to be assigned to an alias in your `.bashrc`.
See each folder's `README` for its purpose


## Compilation of changes
If you end up changing some of these, be sure to compile them to their `.sh` runnable counter-parts using `compile-py2sh.py`.
We convert the to `.sh` since its better to run from the terminal.

## Usage 
```
python compile-py2sh.py [folder-name]
```

## Examples
```
python compile-py2sh.py python-shell
python compile-py2sh.py gg
python compile-py2sh.py activate-recur
```
